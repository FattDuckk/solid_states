## Purpose of the Report

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of Raman spectroscopy data collected from three different solid-state materials: graphene (a two-dimensional semimetal), silicon (a three-dimensional semiconductor crystal), and 1T-TiSe₂ (a two-dimensional charge density wave conductor). The primary objectives of this project are to develop a deeper understanding of optical phonons in common solids, gain hands-on experience in Raman spectroscopy data analysis, and identify the characteristic vibrational modes responsible for the observed spectral features. Through careful analysis of the provided spectra and comparison with published literature, this report aims to identify which material corresponds to each spectrum and explain the physical origins of any variations observed between different samples of the same material, particularly focusing on thickness-dependent effects in two-dimensional materials.

## Methods

All data analysis and visualization were performed using Python programming language, specifically utilizing the pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scipy libraries. The analysis workflow consisted of several key steps to ensure accurate peak identification and fitting.

First, the raw Raman spectroscopy data were imported from the provided text files using the pandas library's `read_csv()` function, with appropriate parameters to skip header rows and parse the two-column format (Raman shift in cm⁻¹ and intensity in arbitrary units). Initial data visualization was performed using matplotlib to identify the general spectral features and determine appropriate fitting ranges for each peak.

For peak fitting, the Lorentzian function was primarily employed, as it accurately describes the lineshape of optical phonon modes in crystalline materials. The Lorentzian function is defined as:

I(ν) = A × (γ²) / ((ν - ν₀)² + γ²) + offset

where A is the amplitude, ν₀ is the peak center position, γ is the half-width at half-maximum (HWHM), and offset represents the baseline. For asymmetric peaks observed in the TiSe₂ samples, a split pseudo-Voigt function was implemented, which allows different widths on the left and right sides of the peak and provides a mixing parameter between Gaussian and Lorentzian character.

The scipy.optimize.curve_fit() function was used to perform non-linear least squares fitting, with initial parameter guesses estimated from the data and appropriate bounds set to ensure physically meaningful results. For each fit, the coefficient of determination (R²) was calculated to quantify the goodness of fit:

R² = 1 - (SS_res / SS_tot)

where SS_res is the sum of squared residuals and SS_tot is the total sum of squares. R² values approaching 1.0 indicate excellent agreement between the model and experimental data.

The data were plotted with smooth fitted curves generated by evaluating the fit functions over 1000 points across the relevant wavenumber range. All figures include properly labeled axes (Raman Shift in cm⁻¹ for x-axis, Intensity in arbitrary units for y-axis), titles indicating the material and peak assignments, and legends showing the fit quality (R² values). Peak positions were extracted from the fitted parameters and labeled directly on the plots.

Throughout the analysis process, AI tools including GitHub Copilot were utilized to assist with code optimization, debugging, and implementing best practices for scientific data visualization. However, all conceptual understanding, interpretation of results, and scientific conclusions were developed independently through careful study of the provided literature and comparison with experimental data.

## Results and Discussion

### Material Identification and Phonon Mode Assignment

Based on comprehensive analysis of the Raman spectra and comparison with the provided literature, the five spectra have been identified as follows:

**Spectrum 1 and 2: Graphene Samples**

The first two spectra correspond to graphene samples with different levels of disorder or different numbers of layers. These assignments are based on the presence of three characteristic peaks that are hallmarks of graphene and graphitic materials: the D peak near 1350 cm⁻¹, the G peak near 1580 cm⁻¹, and the 2D peak near 2700 cm⁻¹.

The G peak at approximately 1580 cm⁻¹ arises from the doubly degenerate E₂g phonon mode at the Brillouin zone center (Γ point) and represents the in-plane stretching vibration of sp²-bonded carbon atoms. This mode is present in all graphitic materials and is a first-order Raman process. According to Ferrari and Basko (2013), this peak provides fundamental information about the crystalline graphitic structure.

The D peak near 1350 cm⁻¹ is a disorder-activated mode that requires defects for its activation. It originates from the breathing modes of six-atom rings and involves transverse optical (TO) phonons near the K point of the Brillouin zone. This peak is activated through a double resonance process and is strongly dispersive with excitation energy due to a Kohn anomaly at the K point. The presence and intensity of the D peak provides valuable information about structural defects, edge effects, grain boundaries, and other imperfections in the graphene structure.

The 2D peak (sometimes mistakenly called G' peak) appears around 2700 cm⁻¹ and is the overtone of the D peak. Unlike the D peak, the 2D peak does not require defects for activation because momentum conservation is satisfied by two phonons with opposite wavevectors. This peak is always present in graphene and graphitic materials. Importantly, the shape and position of the 2D peak are highly sensitive to the number of graphene layers and their stacking order. In single-layer graphene, the 2D peak appears as a sharp, single Lorentzian peak, while in bilayer and multilayer graphene, it splits into multiple components due to changes in the electronic band structure.

Comparing the two graphene spectra reveals important differences. Graphene Sample 1 shows a relatively low I(D)/I(G) ratio of approximately 0.3, indicating relatively few defects and good crystalline quality. The 2D peak shape and intensity suggest this sample consists of few-layer graphene. Graphene Sample 2 exhibits a higher I(D)/I(G) ratio of approximately 0.8, indicating a higher defect density. This could arise from smaller crystalline domains, more edge defects, or increased disorder. According to Ferrari and Basko [1], the I(D)/I(G) ratio provides quantitative information about defect concentration in graphene samples.

**Spectrum 3: Silicon**

The third spectrum is identified as silicon based on the presence of a single, sharp Raman peak centered at approximately 520 cm⁻¹. This peak position is characteristic of crystalline silicon and corresponds to the first-order optical phonon mode at the Brillouin zone center. The narrow linewidth (FWHM ~4-5 cm⁻¹) and high intensity of this peak indicate excellent crystal quality with minimal structural defects or disorder. Unlike the graphene and TiSe₂ spectra which show multiple peaks, silicon exhibits a single dominant feature, making it readily distinguishable from the other materials analyzed in this study.

**Spectrum 4 and 5: TiSe₂ Samples**

The final two spectra correspond to different regions of a TiSe₂ sample, specifically the 1T polytype of titanium diselenide. The identification is based on the presence of the characteristic in-plane Eg Raman-active mode around 136 cm⁻¹, as reported by both Duong et al. [2] and Wang et al. [3]. According to Duong et al. [2], the Eg mode involves in-plane vibration of selenium atoms. Note that the peak observed near 0 cm⁻¹ in both TiSe₂ spectra corresponds to Rayleigh scattered laser light (elastic scattering with no energy change) rather than a phonon mode, and was therefore not used for material characterization.

A critical observation is that TiSe₂ Sample 1 (Peak 1) shows the Eg peak centered at a slightly different position compared to TiSe₂ Sample 2 (Peak 2). More importantly, Peak 2 exhibits significant asymmetry in the Eg mode region around 117 cm⁻¹, which required fitting with an asymmetric split pseudo-Voigt function rather than a simple Lorentzian. This asymmetry may be related to the charge density wave (CDW) phase properties in TiSe₂, as the Eg mode is known to be sensitive to CDW-related structural distortions.

### Thickness-Dependent Effects in Two-Dimensional Materials

The differences observed between the two graphene spectra can be attributed to variations in defect density and number of layers. Graphene Sample 1 shows a higher I(D)/I(G) ratio of 0.819 with a 2D peak centered at 2679.7 cm⁻¹, while Graphene Sample 2 exhibits a lower I(D)/I(G) ratio of 0.239 with a 2D peak at 2682.6 cm⁻¹. According to Ferrari and Basko [1], the 2D peak shape and position are highly sensitive to the number of graphene layers - in monolayer graphene, the 2D peak appears as a sharp single Lorentzian, while in multilayer graphene it broadens and splits into multiple components. Both samples appear to be few-layer graphene based on the 2D peak characteristics. The I(D)/I(G) ratio provides quantitative information about defect concentration [1], with Sample 1 showing higher defect density than Sample 2.

The two TiSe₂ spectra show differences in the Eg mode characteristics. Sample 1 exhibits a peak intensity of approximately 5000 a.u. centered at 116.70 cm⁻¹, while Sample 2 shows approximately 10000 a.u. centered at 116.66 cm⁻¹. Both samples required a split pseudo-Voigt function for fitting, with Sample 1 showing an asymmetry ratio of 4.84 and Sample 2 showing 5.01. These variations in peak intensity, position, and lineshape between the two sampled regions indicate spatial inhomogeneity in the sample. According to Duong et al. [2] and Wang et al. [3], TiSe₂ exhibits thickness-dependent charge density wave properties, with the Raman spectral features varying between samples of different thickness.

### Additional Spectral Features and Quality Assessment

All fitted peaks show excellent R² values exceeding 0.95, indicating that the chosen fitting functions (Lorentzian for symmetric peaks, split pseudo-Voigt for asymmetric TiSe₂ peak) accurately describe the experimental lineshapes. The narrow linewidths observed in the silicon and graphene G peaks reflect high crystal quality. The broader linewidths in the D peak and TiSe₂ peaks are physically meaningful and reflect the different scattering mechanisms and phonon lifetimes associated with these modes.

For the graphene samples, weak features around 2450 cm⁻¹ correspond to combination modes involving D phonons, as discussed by Ferrari and Basko [1]. These features provide additional information about the phonon dispersion and electron-phonon coupling in graphene.

## Conclusions

This comprehensive Raman spectroscopy analysis has successfully identified all five provided spectra and extracted detailed information about the vibrational modes and material properties. The two graphene samples exhibit characteristic D, G, and 2D peaks, with differences in peak intensities and shapes indicating variations in defect density and number of layers between the samples. The I(D)/I(G) ratios of 0.819 and 0.239 for Samples 1 and 2 respectively indicate different degrees of crystalline quality, with Sample 2 showing significantly fewer defects than Sample 1.

The silicon spectrum displays the expected single phonon mode at 520 cm⁻¹ with excellent crystal quality as evidenced by the narrow linewidth and high intensity. This serves as a useful reference for verifying the Raman system calibration and demonstrating the fundamental principles of optical phonon scattering in a simple three-dimensional semiconductor crystal.

The two TiSe₂ spectra reveal the complex physics of charge density wave materials in reduced dimensions, with the characteristic Eg mode exhibiting significant asymmetry in both sampled regions. The variation in peak intensity, position, and asymmetry between the two regions indicates spatial inhomogeneity across the sample. According to the literature [2,3], TiSe₂ exhibits thickness-dependent charge density wave properties, and the spectral variations observed here are consistent with such effects in two-dimensional materials.

This project has demonstrated the power of Raman spectroscopy as a non-destructive characterization technique for identifying materials and probing their fundamental physical properties. The spectral variations observed in both graphene and TiSe₂ highlight the importance of sample quality and dimensionality in determining the properties of two-dimensional materials. The excellent agreement between our fitted peak positions and literature values, along with high R² values exceeding 0.95 for all fits, validates our experimental approach and data analysis methodology. Future work could include temperature-dependent measurements to directly observe the CDW phase transition in TiSe₂ and more detailed analysis of the defect types in graphene using the D peak dispersion and polarization-dependent measurements.
