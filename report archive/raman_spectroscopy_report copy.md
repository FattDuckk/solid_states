## Purpose of the Report

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of Raman spectroscopy data collected from three different solid-state materials: graphene (a two-dimensional semimetal), silicon (a three-dimensional semiconductor crystal), and 1T-TiSe₂ (a two-dimensional charge density wave conductor). The primary objectives of this project are to develop a deeper understanding of optical phonons in common solids, gain hands-on experience in Raman spectroscopy data analysis, and identify the characteristic vibrational modes responsible for the observed spectral features. Through careful analysis of the provided spectra and comparison with published literature, this report aims to identify which material corresponds to each spectrum and explain the physical origins of any variations observed between different samples of the same material, particularly focusing on thickness-dependent effects in two-dimensional materials.

## Methods

All data analysis and visualization were performed using Python programming language, specifically utilizing the pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scipy libraries. The analysis workflow consisted of several key steps to ensure accurate peak identification and fitting.

First, the raw Raman spectroscopy data were imported from the provided text files using the pandas library's `read_csv()` function, with appropriate parameters to skip header rows and parse the two-column format (Raman shift in cm⁻¹ and intensity in arbitrary units). Initial data visualization was performed using matplotlib to identify the general spectral features and determine appropriate fitting ranges for each peak.

For peak fitting, the Lorentzian function was primarily employed, as it accurately describes the lineshape of optical phonon modes in crystalline materials. The Lorentzian function is defined as:

I(ν) = A × (γ²) / ((ν - ν₀)² + γ²) + offset

where A is the amplitude, ν₀ is the peak center position, γ is the half-width at half-maximum (HWHM), and offset represents the baseline. For asymmetric peaks observed in the TiSe₂ samples, a split pseudo-Voigt function was implemented, which allows different widths on the left and right sides of the peak and provides a mixing parameter between Gaussian and Lorentzian character.

The scipy.optimize.curve_fit() function was used to perform non-linear least squares fitting, with initial parameter guesses estimated from the data and appropriate bounds set to ensure physically meaningful results. For each fit, the coefficient of determination (R²) was calculated to quantify the goodness of fit:

R² = 1 - (SS_res / SS_tot)

where SS_res is the sum of squared residuals and SS_tot is the total sum of squares. R² values approaching 1.0 indicate excellent agreement between the model and experimental data.

The data were plotted with smooth fitted curves generated by evaluating the fit functions over 1000 points across the relevant wavenumber range. All figures include properly labeled axes (Raman Shift in cm⁻¹ for x-axis, Intensity in arbitrary units for y-axis), titles indicating the material and peak assignments, and legends showing the fit quality (R² values). Peak positions were extracted from the fitted parameters and labeled directly on the plots.

Throughout the analysis process, AI tools including GitHub Copilot were utilized to assist with code optimization, debugging, and implementing best practices for scientific data visualization. However, all conceptual understanding, interpretation of results, and scientific conclusions were developed independently through careful study of the provided literature and comparison with experimental data.

## Results and Discussion

### Material Identification and Phonon Mode Assignment

Based on comprehensive analysis of the Raman spectra and comparison with the provided literature, the five spectra have been identified as follows:

**Spectrum 1 and 2: Graphene Samples**

The first two spectra correspond to graphene samples with different levels of disorder or different numbers of layers. These assignments are based on the presence of three characteristic peaks that are hallmarks of graphene and graphitic materials: the D peak near 1350 cm⁻¹, the G peak near 1580 cm⁻¹, and the 2D peak near 2700 cm⁻¹.

The G peak at approximately 1580 cm⁻¹ arises from the doubly degenerate E₂g phonon mode at the Brillouin zone center (Γ point) and represents the in-plane stretching vibration of sp²-bonded carbon atoms. This mode is present in all graphitic materials and is a first-order Raman process. According to Ferrari and Basko (2013), this peak provides fundamental information about the crystalline graphitic structure.

The D peak near 1350 cm⁻¹ is a disorder-activated mode that requires defects for its activation. It originates from the breathing modes of six-atom rings and involves transverse optical (TO) phonons near the K point of the Brillouin zone. This peak is activated through a double resonance process and is strongly dispersive with excitation energy due to a Kohn anomaly at the K point. The presence and intensity of the D peak provides valuable information about structural defects, edge effects, grain boundaries, and other imperfections in the graphene structure.

The 2D peak (sometimes mistakenly called G' peak) appears around 2700 cm⁻¹ and is the overtone of the D peak. Unlike the D peak, the 2D peak does not require defects for activation because momentum conservation is satisfied by two phonons with opposite wavevectors. This peak is always present in graphene and graphitic materials. Importantly, the shape and position of the 2D peak are highly sensitive to the number of graphene layers and their stacking order. In single-layer graphene, the 2D peak appears as a sharp, single Lorentzian peak, while in bilayer and multilayer graphene, it splits into multiple components due to changes in the electronic band structure.

Comparing the two graphene spectra reveals important differences. Graphene Sample 1 shows a relatively low I(D)/I(G) ratio of approximately 0.3, indicating relatively few defects and good crystalline quality. The 2D peak shape and intensity suggest this sample consists of few-layer graphene. Graphene Sample 2 exhibits a higher I(D)/I(G) ratio of approximately 0.8, indicating a higher defect density. This could arise from smaller crystalline domains, more edge defects, or increased disorder. According to Ferrari and Basko [1], the I(D)/I(G) ratio provides quantitative information about defect concentration in graphene samples.

**Spectrum 3: Silicon**

The third spectrum is identified as silicon based on the presence of a single, sharp Raman peak centered at approximately 520 cm⁻¹. This peak position is characteristic of crystalline silicon and corresponds to the first-order optical phonon mode at the Brillouin zone center. The narrow linewidth (FWHM ~4-5 cm⁻¹) and high intensity of this peak indicate excellent crystal quality with minimal structural defects or disorder. Unlike the graphene and TiSe₂ spectra which show multiple peaks, silicon exhibits a single dominant feature, making it readily distinguishable from the other materials analyzed in this study.

**Spectrum 4 and 5: TiSe₂ Samples**

The final two spectra correspond to different regions of a TiSe₂ sample, specifically the 1T polytype of titanium diselenide. The identification is based on the presence of two primary Raman-active modes characteristic of 1T-TiSe₂: the in-plane Eg mode around 136 cm⁻¹ and the out-of-plane A₁g mode around 200 cm⁻¹, as reported by both Duong et al. [2] and Wang et al. [3].

According to Duong et al. [2], the Eg mode involves in-plane vibration of selenium atoms, while the A₁g mode corresponds to out-of-plane vibrations. These assignments are consistent with density functional theory calculations.

A critical observation is that TiSe₂ Sample 1 (Peak 1) shows peaks centered at slightly different positions compared to TiSe₂ Sample 2 (Peak 2). More importantly, Peak 2 exhibits significant asymmetry, particularly in the region around 117 cm⁻¹, which required fitting with an asymmetric split pseudo-Voigt function rather than a simple Lorentzian. This asymmetry may be related to the charge density wave (CDW) phase properties in TiSe₂.

### Thickness-Dependent Effects in Two-Dimensional Materials

**Graphene Thickness Dependence:**

The differences observed between the two graphene spectra can be attributed to variations in the number of layers and/or defect density. According to Ferrari and Basko (2013), the 2D peak is particularly sensitive to the number of layers. In single-layer graphene, the 2D peak appears as a single sharp Lorentzian with I(2D)/I(G) > 2. As the number of layers increases, the 2D peak broadens, splits into multiple components, and decreases in relative intensity. The splitting occurs because the interlayer interaction in multilayer graphene modifies the electronic band structure, creating additional electronic transition pathways for the double resonance process.

In our spectra, the 2D peak shape and I(2D)/I(G) ratio suggest both samples consist of few-layer graphene rather than true monolayer material. The broader 2D peak and lower I(2D)/I(G) ratio in one sample compared to the other indicate it contains more layers. The G peak position can also shift slightly with the number of layers due to changes in electron-phonon coupling, though this effect is relatively subtle compared to the 2D peak changes.

The variation in D peak intensity between the two samples reflects differences in defect density rather than thickness. As noted by Ferrari and Basko [1], the D peak is activated only in the presence of defects, making its intensity a direct measure of disorder in the graphene samples.

**TiSe₂ Thickness and CDW Effects:**

The two TiSe₂ spectra reveal physics related to the charge density wave phase transition in this material. According to both Duong et al. [2] and Wang et al. [3], TiSe₂ is a layered transition metal dichalcogenide that undergoes a CDW transition at approximately 200 K in bulk form. Below this transition temperature, the crystal structure distorts from the normal 1×1×1 phase to a 2×2×2 CDW phase.

The asymmetry observed in Peak 2 of the TiSe₂ sample may reflect the presence of CDW-related effects. Duong et al. [2] demonstrated that the CDW transition temperature in TiSe₂ exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on thickness. Wang et al. [3] reported that few-layer TiSe₂ (approximately 3.7 nm thick) shows a CDW transition temperature of 212.5 K, which is notably higher than the bulk value of approximately 200 K. This represents an enhancement of the CDW order in thin layers.

However, Duong et al. [2] found that for monolayer samples (1.4 nm thick), the transition temperature decreases to approximately 202.5 K. Wang et al. [3] noted that surface oxidation can affect the stability of very thin TiSe₂ samples. The different peak positions and shapes between the two TiSe₂ regions in our data indicate spatial variation in thickness across the sample, with one region potentially being thicker than the other.

Duong et al. [2] established that the Eg mode position near 136 cm⁻¹ is particularly useful for monitoring the CDW transition. They showed that this peak's position exhibits a characteristic temperature dependence: it initially shifts to higher wavenumber upon cooling, then reverses direction at the CDW transition temperature. This behavior makes Raman spectroscopy a powerful tool for determining the transition temperature in TiSe₂ samples of varying thickness.

### Additional Spectral Features and Quality Assessment

All fitted peaks show excellent R² values exceeding 0.95, indicating that the chosen fitting functions (Lorentzian for symmetric peaks, split pseudo-Voigt for asymmetric TiSe₂ peak) accurately describe the experimental lineshapes. The narrow linewidths observed in the silicon and graphene G peaks reflect high crystal quality. The broader linewidths in the D peak and TiSe₂ peaks are physically meaningful and reflect the different scattering mechanisms and phonon lifetimes associated with these modes.

For the graphene samples, weak features around 2450 cm⁻¹ correspond to combination modes involving D phonons, as discussed by Ferrari and Basko [1]. These features provide additional information about the phonon dispersion and electron-phonon coupling in graphene.

## Conclusions

This comprehensive Raman spectroscopy analysis has successfully identified all five provided spectra and extracted detailed information about the vibrational modes and material properties. The two graphene samples exhibit characteristic D, G, and 2D peaks, with differences in peak intensities and shapes indicating variations in defect density and number of layers between the samples. The I(D)/I(G) ratios of approximately 0.3 and 0.8 for Samples 1 and 2 respectively indicate different degrees of crystalline quality, with Sample 1 showing fewer defects.

The silicon spectrum displays the expected single phonon mode at 520 cm⁻¹ with excellent crystal quality as evidenced by the narrow linewidth and high intensity. This serves as a useful reference for verifying the Raman system calibration and demonstrating the fundamental principles of optical phonon scattering in a simple three-dimensional semiconductor crystal.

The two TiSe₂ spectra reveal the complex physics of charge density wave materials in reduced dimensions, with characteristic Eg and A₁g modes and significant asymmetry in one region. The variation between the two sampled regions indicates spatial inhomogeneity in sample thickness. According to the literature [2,3], the CDW transition temperature in TiSe₂ depends on sample thickness, with few-layer samples exhibiting enhanced transition temperatures compared to bulk material.

This project has demonstrated the power of Raman spectroscopy as a non-destructive characterization technique for identifying materials and probing their fundamental physical properties. The thickness-dependent effects observed in both graphene and TiSe₂ highlight the importance of dimensionality in determining the properties of two-dimensional materials. The excellent agreement between our fitted peak positions and literature values validates our experimental approach and data analysis methodology. Future work could include temperature-dependent measurements to directly observe the CDW phase transition in TiSe₂ and more detailed analysis of the defect types in graphene using the D peak dispersion and polarization-dependent measurements.
